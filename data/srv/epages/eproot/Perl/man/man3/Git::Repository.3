.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Git::Repository is a Perl interface to Git, for scripted interactions
with repositories. It's a low-level interface that allows calling any Git
command, whether \fIporcelain\fR or \fIplumbing\fR, including bidirectional
commands such as \f(CW\*(C`git commit\-tree\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A Git::Repository object simply provides context to the git commands
being run. It is possible to call the  \f(CW\*(C`command()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR methods
against the class itself, and the context (typically \fIcurrent working
directory\fR) will be obtained from the options and environment.
.PP
As a low-level interface, it provides no sugar for particular Git
commands. Specifically, it will not prepare environment variables that
individual Git commands may need or use.
.PP
However, the \f(CW\*(C`GIT_DIR\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`GIT_WORK_TREE\*(C'\fR environment variables are
special: if the command is run in the context of a Git::Repository
object, they will be overridden by the object's \f(CW\*(C`git_dir\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`work_tree\*(C'\fR attributes, respectively. It is however still possible to
override them if necessary, using the \f(CW\*(C`env\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Git::Repository requires at least Git 1.5.0, and is expected to support
any later version.
.PP
See Git::Repository::Tutorial for more code examples.
.SH "CONSTRUCTOR"
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTOR"
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 1
\&    Git::Repository\->new( %args, $options );
.Ve
.PP
Create a new Git::Repository object, based on an existing Git repository.
.PP
Parameters are:
.ie n .IP "git_dir => $gitdir" 4
.el .IP "git_dir => \f(CW$gitdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "git_dir => $gitdir"
The location of the git repository (\fI.git\fR directory or equivalent).
.Sp
For backward compatibility with versions 1.06 and before, \f(CW\*(C`repository\*(C'\fR
is accepted in place of \f(CW\*(C`git_dir\*(C'\fR (but the newer name takes precedence).
.ie n .IP "work_tree => $dir" 4
.el .IP "work_tree => \f(CW$dir\fR" 4
.IX Item "work_tree => $dir"
The location of the git working copy (for a non-bare repository).
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`work_tree\*(C'\fR actually points to a subdirectory of the work tree,
Git::Repository will automatically recompute the proper value.
.Sp
For backward compatibility with versions 1.06 and before, \f(CW\*(C`working_copy\*(C'\fR
is accepted in place of \f(CW\*(C`work_tree\*(C'\fR (but the newer name takes precedence).
.PP
If none of the parameter is given, Git::Repository will find the
appropriate repository just like Git itself does. Otherwise, one of
the parameters is usually enough,
as Git::Repository can work out where the other directory (if any) is.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR also accepts a reference to an option hash which will be used
as the default by Git::Repository::Command when working with the
corresponding Git::Repository instance.
.PP
So this:
.PP
.Vb 11
\&    my $r = Git::Repository\->new(
\&        # parameters
\&        work_tree => $dir,
\&        # options
\&        {   git => \*(Aq/path/to/some/other/git\*(Aq,
\&            env => {
\&                GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL => \*(Aqbook@cpan.org\*(Aq,
\&                GIT_COMMITTER_NAME  => \*(AqPhilippe Bruhat (BooK)\*(Aq,
\&            },
\&        }
\&    );
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to explicitly passing the option hash to each
\&\f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`command()\*(C'\fR call.
The documentation for Git::Repository::Command lists all
available options.
.PP
Note that Git::Repository and Git::Repository::Command take
great care in finding the option hash wherever it may be in \f(CW@_\fR,
and to merge multiple option hashes if more than one is provided.
.PP
It probably makes no sense to set the \f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR option in \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR,
but Git::Repository won't stop you.
Note that on some systems, some git commands may close standard input
on startup, which will cause a \f(CW\*(C`SIGPIPE\*(C'\fR. Git::Repository::Command
will raise an exception.
.PP
To create a Git repository and obtain a Git::Repository object
pointing to it, simply do it in two steps:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    # run a clone or init command without an instance,
\&    # using options like cwd
\&    Git::Repository\->run( ... );
\&    
\&    # obtain a Git::Repository instance
\&    # on the resulting repository
\&    $r = Git::Repository\->new( ... );
.Ve
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
Git::Repository supports the following methods:
.SS "command"
.IX Subsection "command"
.Vb 2
\&    Git::Repository\->command( @cmd );
\&    $r\->command( @cmd );
.Ve
.PP
Runs the git sub-command and options, and returns a Git::Repository::Command
object pointing to the sub-process running the command.
.PP
As described in the Git::Repository::Command documentation, \f(CW@cmd\fR
may also contain a hashref containing options for the command.
.SS "run"
.IX Subsection "run"
.Vb 2
\&    Git::Repository\->run( @cmd );
\&    $r\->run( @cmd );
.Ve
.PP
Runs the command and returns the output as a string in scalar context,
or as a list of lines in list context. Also accepts a hashref of options.
.PP
Lines are automatically \f(CW\*(C`chomp\*(C'\fRed.
.PP
In addition to the options hashref supported by Git::Repository::Command,
the parameter list can also contain code references, that will be applied
successively to each line of output. The line being processed is in \f(CW$_\fR,
but the coderef must still return the result string (like \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If the git command printed anything on stderr, it will be printed as
warnings. For convenience, if the git sub-process exited with status
\&\f(CW128\fR (fatal error), or \f(CW129\fR (usage message), \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR will \f(CW\*(C`die()\*(C'\fR.
The exit status values for which \f(CW\*(C`run()\*(C'\fR dies can be modified using
the \f(CW\*(C`fatal\*(C'\fR option (see Git::Repository::Command for details).
.PP
The exit status of the command that was just run is accessible as usual
using \f(CW\*(C`$? >> 8\*(C'\fR. See perlvar for details about \f(CW$?\fR.
.SS "git_dir"
.IX Subsection "git_dir"
Returns the repository path.
.SS "work_tree"
.IX Subsection "work_tree"
Returns the working copy path.
Used as current working directory by Git::Repository::Command.
.SS "options"
.IX Subsection "options"
Return the option hash that was passed to \f(CW\*(C`Git::Repository\->new()\*(C'\fR.
.SS "version"
.IX Subsection "version"
Return the version of git, as given by \f(CW\*(C`git \-\-version\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS "Version-comparison ""operators"""
.el .SS "Version-comparison ``operators''"
.IX Subsection "Version-comparison operators"
Git evolves very fast, and new features are constantly added.
To facilitate the creation of programs that can properly handle the
wide variety of Git versions seen in the wild, a number of version
comparison \*(L"operators\*(R" are available.
.PP
They are named \f(CW\*(C`version_\f(CIop\f(CW\*(C'\fR where \fIop\fR is the equivalent of the Perl
operators \f(CW\*(C`lt\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`gt\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`le\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ge\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`eq\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ne\*(C'\fR. They return a boolean
value, obtained by comparing the version of the git binary and the
version string passed as parameter.
.PP
The methods are:
.ie n .IP "version_lt( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_lt( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_lt( $version )"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "version_gt( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_gt( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_gt( $version )"
.ie n .IP "version_le( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_le( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_le( $version )"
.ie n .IP "version_ge( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_ge( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_ge( $version )"
.ie n .IP "version_eq( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_eq( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_eq( $version )"
.ie n .IP "version_ne( $version )" 4
.el .IP "version_ne( \f(CW$version\fR )" 4
.IX Item "version_ne( $version )"
.PD
.PP
All those methods also accept an option hash, just like the others.
.PP
Note that in the \f(CW\*(C`git.git\*(C'\fR repository, \f(CW\*(C`v1.0.1\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`v1.0.2\*(C'\fR are
lightweight tags that points respectively to \f(CW\*(C`v1.0.0a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`v1.0.0b\*(C'\fR.
As of Git::Repository 1.314, the comparison code internally converts
\&\f(CW\*(C`v1.0.0a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`v1.0.0b\*(C'\fR to their numerical equivalent before performing
the comparison.
.PP
Prior to \f(CW\*(C`1.4.0\-rc1\*(C'\fR (June 2006), compiling a development version of git
would lead \f(CW\*(C`git \-\-version\*(C'\fR to output \f(CW\*(C`1.x\-GIT\*(C'\fR (with \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`0 .. 3\*(C'\fR),
which would make comparing versions that are very close a futile exercise.
.PP
Other issues exist when comparing development version numbers with one
another. For example, \f(CW1.7.1.1\fR is greater than both \f(CW\*(C`1.7.1.1.gc8c07\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`1.7.1.1.g5f35a\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW1.7.1\fR is less than both. Obviously,
\&\f(CW\*(C`1.7.1.1.gc8c07\*(C'\fR will compare as greater than \f(CW\*(C`1.7.1.1.g5f35a\*(C'\fR
(asciibetically), but in fact these two version numbers cannot be
compared, as they are two siblings children of the commit tagged
\&\f(CW\*(C`v1.7.1\*(C'\fR).
.PP
If one were to compute the set of all possible version numbers (as returned
by \f(CW\*(C`git \-\-version\*(C'\fR) for all git versions that can be compiled from each
commit in the \fIgit.git\fR repository, the result would not be a totally ordered
set. Big deal.
.PP
Also, don't be too precise when requiring the minimum version of Git that
supported a given feature. The precise commit in git.git at which a given
feature was added doesn't mean as much as the release branch in which that
commit was merged.
.SH "PLUGIN SUPPORT"
.IX Header "PLUGIN SUPPORT"
Git::Repository intentionally has only few methods.
The idea is to provide a lightweight wrapper around git, to be used
to create interesting tools based on Git.
.PP
However, people will want to add extra functionality to Git::Repository,
the obvious example being a \f(CW\*(C`log()\*(C'\fR method that returns simple objects
with useful attributes.
.PP
Taking the hypothetical \f(CW\*(C`Git::Repository::Plugin::Hello\*(C'\fR module which
source code is listed in the previous reference, the methods it provides
would be loaded and used as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Git::Repository qw( Hello );
\&
\&    my $r = Git::Repository\->new();
\&    print $r\->hello();
\&    print $r\->hello_gitdir();
.Ve
.PP
It's possible to load only a selection of methods from the plugin:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Git::Repository [ Hello => \*(Aqhello\*(Aq ];
\&
\&    my $r = Git::Repository\->new();
\&    print $r\->hello();
\&
\&    # dies: Can\*(Aqt locate object method "hello_gitdir"
\&    print $r\->hello_gitdir();
.Ve
.PP
If your plugin lives in another namespace than \f(CW\*(C`Git::Repository::Plugin::\*(C'\fR,
just prefix the fully qualified class name with a \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Git::Repository qw( +MyGit::Hello );
.Ve
.PP
See Git::Repository::Plugin about how to create a new plugin.
.SH "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
.IX Header "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
Thanks to Todd Rinaldo, who wanted to add more methods to
Git::Repository, which made me look for a solution that would preserve
the minimalism of Git::Repository. The \f(CW\*(C`::Plugin\*(C'\fR interface is what
I came up with.
.SH "OTHER PERL GIT WRAPPERS (a.k.a. SEE ALSO)"
.IX Header "OTHER PERL GIT WRAPPERS (a.k.a. SEE ALSO)"
(This section was written in June 2010. The other Git wrappers have
probably evolved since that time.)
.PP
A number of Perl git wrappers already exist. Why create a new one?
.PP
I have a lot of ideas of nice things to do with Git as a tool to
manipulate blobs, trees, and tags, that may or may not represent
revision history of a project. A lot of those commands can output
huge amounts of data, which I need to be able to process in chunks.
Some of these commands also expect to receive input.
.PP
What follows is a short list of \*(L"missing features\*(R" that I was looking
for when I looked at the existing Git wrappers on \s-1CPAN\s0. They are the
\&\*(L"rational\*(R" reason for writing my own (the real reason being of course
\&\*(L"I thought it would be fun, and I enjoyed doing it\*(R").
.PP
Even though it works well for me and others, Git::Repository has its
own shortcomings: it \fIis\fR a \fIlow-level interface to Git commands\fR,
anything complex requires you to deal with input/output handles,
it provides no high-level interface to generate actual Git commands
or process the output of commands (but have a look at the plugins), etc.
One the following modules may therefore be better suited for your needs,
depending on what you're trying to achieve.
.SS "Git.pm"
.IX Subsection "Git.pm"
Git.pm was not on \s-1CPAN\s0 in 2010. It is packaged with Git, and installed
with the system Perl libraries. Not being on \s-1CPAN\s0 made it harder to
install in any Perl. It made it harder for a \s-1CPAN\s0 library to depend on it.
.PP
It doesn't allow calling \f(CW\*(C`git init\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`git clone\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`command_bidi_pipe\*(C'\fR function especially has problems:
<http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/10/24/3789584>
.PP
The Git module from git.git was packaged as a \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution by
\&\s-1MSOUTH\s0 in June 2013.
.SS "Git::Class"
.IX Subsection "Git::Class"
Git::Class
depends on Moose, which seems an unnecessary dependency for a simple
wrapper around Git. The startup penalty could become significant for
command-line tools.
.PP
Although it supports \f(CW\*(C`git init\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`git clone\*(C'\fR
(and has methods to call any Git command), it is mostly aimed at
porcelain commands, and provides no way to control bidirectional commands
(such as \f(CW\*(C`git commit\-tree\*(C'\fR).
.SS "Git::Wrapper"
.IX Subsection "Git::Wrapper"
Git::Wrapper
doesn't support streams or bidirectional commands.
.SS "Git::Sub"
.IX Subsection "Git::Sub"
(This description was added for completeness in May 2013.)
.PP
Git::Sub appeared in 2013, as a set of Git-specific System::Sub
functions. It provide a nice set of \f(CW\*(C`git::\*(C'\fR functions, and has some
limitations (due to the way System::Sub itself works) which don't
impact most Git commands.
.PP
Git::Sub doesn't support working with streams.
.SS "Git::Raw"
.IX Subsection "Git::Raw"
(This description was added for completeness in September 2014,
upon request of the author of Git::Raw.)
.PP
Git::Raw
provides bindings to libgit2 <http://libgit2.github.com/>, a pure C
implementation of the Git core methods. Most of the functions provided by
libgit2 are available. If you have complex workflows, or even if speed is of
the essence, this may be a more attractive solution than shelling out to git.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Since version 1.17, Git::Repository delegates the actual command
execution to System::Command, which has better support for Win32
since version 1.100.
