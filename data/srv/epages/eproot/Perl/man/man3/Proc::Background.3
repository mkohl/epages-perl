.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is a generic interface for placing processes in the background on
both Unix and Win32 platforms.  This module lets you start, kill, wait
on, retrieve exit values, and see if background processes still exist.

.PD
This creates a new background process.  As \fIexec()\fR or \fIsystem()\fR may be
passed an array with a single single string element containing a
command to be passed to the shell or an array with more than one
element to be run without calling the shell, \fBnew\fR has the same
behavior.
.Sp
In certain cases \fBnew\fR will attempt to find \fIcommand\fR on the system
and fail if it cannot be found.
.Sp
For Win32 operating systems:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    The Win32::Process module is always used to spawn background
\&    processes on the Win32 platform.  This module always takes a
\&    single string argument containing the executable\*(Aqs name and
\&    any option arguments.  In addition, it requires that the
\&    absolute path to the executable is also passed to it.  If
\&    only a single argument is passed to new, then it is split on
\&    whitespace into an array and the first element of the split
\&    array is used at the executable\*(Aqs name.  If multiple
\&    arguments are passed to new, then the first element is used
\&    as the executable\*(Aqs name.
\&
\&    If the executable\*(Aqs name is an absolute path, then new
\&    checks to see if the executable exists in the given location
\&    or fails otherwise.  If the executable\*(Aqs name is not
\&    absolute, then the executable is searched for using the PATH
\&    environmental variable.  The input executable name is always
\&    replaced with the absolute path determined by this process.
\&
\&    In addition, when searching for the executable, the
\&    executable is searched for using the unchanged executable
\&    name and if that is not found, then it is checked by
\&    appending \`.exe\*(Aq to the name in case the name was passed
\&    without the \`.exe\*(Aq suffix.
\&
\&    Finally, the argument array is placed back into a single
\&    string and passed to Win32::Process::Create.
.Ve
.Sp
For non\-Win32 operating systems, such as Unix:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&    If more than one argument is passed to new, then new
\&    assumes that the command will not be passed through the
\&    shell and the first argument is the executable\*(Aqs relative
\&    or absolute path.  If the first argument is an absolute
\&    path, then it is checked to see if it exists and can be
\&    run, otherwise new fails.  If the path is not absolute,
\&    then the PATH environmental variable is checked to see if
\&    the executable can be found.  If the executable cannot be
\&    found, then new fails.  These steps are taking to prevent
\&    exec() from failing after an fork() without the caller of
\&    new knowing that something failed.
.Ve
.Sp
The first argument to \fBnew\fR \fIoptions\fR may be a reference to a hash
which contains key/value pairs to modify Proc::Background's behavior.
Currently the only key understood by \fBnew\fR is \fIdie_upon_destroy\fR.
When this value is set to true, then when the Proc::Background object
is being \s-1DESTROY\s0'ed for any reason (i.e. the variable goes out of
scope) the process is killed via the \fIdie()\fR method.
.Sp
If anything fails, then new returns an empty list in a list context,
an undefined value in a scalar context, or nothing in a void context.
.IP "\fBpid\fR" 4
.IX Item "pid"
Returns the process \s-1ID\s0 of the created process.  This value is saved
even if the process has already finished.
.IP "\fBalive\fR" 4
.IX Item "alive"
Return 1 if the process is still active, 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBdie\fR" 4
.IX Item "die"
Reliably try to kill the process.  Returns 1 if the process no longer
exists once \fBdie\fR has completed, 0 otherwise.  This will also return
1 if the process has already died.  On Unix, the following signals are
sent to the process in one second intervals until the process dies:
\&\s-1HUP\s0, \s-1QUIT\s0, \s-1INT\s0, \s-1KILL\s0.
.IP "\fBwait\fR" 4
.IX Item "wait"
Wait for the process to exit.  Return the exit status of the command
as returned by \fIwait()\fR on the system.  To get the actual exit value,
divide by 256 or right bit shift by 8, regardless of the operating
system being used.  If the process never existed, then return an empty
list in a list context, an undefined value in a scalar context, or
nothing in a void context.  This function may be called multiple times
even after the process has exited and it will return the same exit
status.
.IP "\fBstart_time\fR" 4
.IX Item "start_time"
Return the value that the Perl function \fItime()\fR returned when the
process was started.
.IP "\fBend_time\fR" 4
.IX Item "end_time"
Return the value that the Perl function \fItime()\fR returned when the exit
status was obtained from the process.

.IP "\fBtimeout_system\fR '\fItimeout\fR \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg\fR [\fIarg\fR...]]'" 4
.IX Item "timeout_system 'timeout command [arg [arg...]]'"
.PD
Run a command for \fItimeout\fR seconds and if the process did not exit,
then kill it.  While the timeout is implemented using \fIsleep()\fR, this
function makes sure that the full \fItimeout\fR is reached before killing
the process.  \fBtimeout_system\fR does not wait for the complete
\&\fItimeout\fR number of seconds before checking if the process has
exited.  Rather, it sleeps repeatidly for 1 second and checks to see
if the process still exists.
.Sp
In a scalar context, \fBtimeout_system\fR returns the exit status from
the process.  In an array context, \fBtimeout_system\fR returns a two
element array, where the first element is the exist status from the
process and the second is set to 1 if the process was killed by
\&\fBtimeout_system\fR or 0 if the process exited by itself.
.Sp
The exit status is the value returned from the \fIwait()\fR call.  If the
process was killed, then the return value will include the killing of
it.  To get the actual exit value, divide by 256.
.Sp
If something failed in the creation of the process, the subroutine
returns an empty list in a list context, an undefined value in a
scalar context, or nothing in a void context.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION"
.IX Header "IMPLEMENTATION"
\&\fIProc::Background\fR comes with two modules, \fIProc::Background::Unix\fR
and \fIProc::Background::Win32\fR.  Currently, on Unix platforms
\&\fIProc::Background\fR uses the \fIProc::Background::Unix\fR class and on
Win32 platforms it uses \fIProc::Background::Win32\fR, which makes use of
\&\fIWin32::Process\fR.
.PP
The \fIProc::Background\fR assigns to \f(CW@ISA\fR either
\&\fIProc::Background::Unix\fR or \fIProc::Background::Win32\fR, which does
the \s-1OS\s0 dependent work.  The \s-1OS\s0 independent work is done in
\&\fIProc::Background\fR.
.PP
Proc::Background uses two variables to keep track of the process.
\&\f(CW$self\fR\->{_os_obj} contains the operating system object to reference the
process.  On a Unix systems this is the process id (pid).  On Win32,
it is an object returned from the \fIWin32::Process\fR class.  When
\&\f(CW$self\fR\->{_os_obj} exists, then the process is running.  When the
process dies, this is recorded by deleting \f(CW$self\fR\->{_os_obj} and saving
the exit value \f(CW$self\fR\->{_exit_value}.
.PP
Anytime \fIalive\fR is called, a \fIwaitpid()\fR is called on the process and
the return status, if any, is gathered and saved for a call to
\&\fIwait\fR.  This module does not install a signal handler for \s-1SIGCHLD\s0.
If for some reason, the user has installed a signal handler for
\&\s-1SIGCHLD\s0, then, then when this module calls \fIwaitpid()\fR, the failure will
be noticed and taken as the exited child, but it won't be able to
gather the exit status.  In this case, the exit status will be set to
0.
