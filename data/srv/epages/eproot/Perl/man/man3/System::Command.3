.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
System::Command is a class that launches external system commands
and return an object representing them, allowing to interact with them
through their \f(CW\*(C`STDIN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`STDOUT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`STDERR\*(C'\fR handles.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
System::Command supports the following methods:
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 1
\&    my $cmd = System::Command\->new( @cmd )
.Ve
.PP
Runs an external command using the list in \f(CW@cmd\fR.
.PP
If \f(CW@cmd\fR contains a hash reference, it is taken as an \fIoption\fR hash.
.PP
If several option hashes are passed to \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR, they will be merged
together with individual values being overridden by those (with the same
key) from hashes that appear later in the list.
.PP
To allow subclasses to support their own set of options, unrecognized
options are silently ignored.
.PP
The recognized keys are:
.ie n .IP """cwd""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcwd\fR" 4
.IX Item "cwd"
The \fIcurrent working directory\fR in which the command will be run.
.ie n .IP """env""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWenv\fR" 4
.IX Item "env"
A hashref containing key / values to add to the command environment.
.Sp
If several option hashes define the \f(CW\*(C`env\*(C'\fR key, the hashes they point
to will be merged into one (instead of the last one taking precedence).
.Sp
If a value is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR, the variable corresponding to the key will
be \fIremoved\fR from the environment.
.ie n .IP """input""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWinput\fR" 4
.IX Item "input"
A string that is send to the command's standard input, which is then closed.
.Sp
Using the empty string as \f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR will close the command's standard input
without writing to it.
.Sp
Using \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as \f(CW\*(C`input\*(C'\fR will not do anything. This behaviour provides
a way to modify previous options populated by some other part of the program.
.Sp
On some systems, some commands may close standard input on startup,
which will cause a \s-1SIGPIPE\s0 when trying to write to it. This will raise
an exception.
.ie n .IP """setpgrp""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsetpgrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "setpgrp"
By default, the spawned process is made the leader of its own process
group using \f(CW\*(C`setpgrp( 0, 0 )\*(C'\fR (if possible). This enables sending a
signal to the command and all its child processes at once:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # negative signal is sent to the process group
\&    kill \-SIGKILL, $cmd\->pid;
.Ve
.Sp
Setting the \f(CW\*(C`setpgrp\*(C'\fR option to a false value disables this behaviour.
.ie n .IP """trace""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtrace\fR" 4
.IX Item "trace"
The \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR option defines the trace settings for System::Command.
The \f(CW\*(C`SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE\*(C'\fR environment variable can be used to specify
a global trace setting at startup. The environment variable overrides
individual \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR options.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE\*(C'\fR contains an \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR character then
what follows it is used as the name of the file to append the trace to.
When using the \f(CW\*(C`trace\*(C'\fR option, it is recommended to use an absolute
path for the trace file, in case the main program \f(CW\*(C`chdir()\*(C'\fR before
calling System::Command.
.Sp
At trace level 1, only the command line is shown:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    System::Command cmd[12834]: /usr/bin/git commit \-m "Test option hash in new()"
.Ve
.Sp
Note: Command-line parameters containing whitespace will be properly quoted.
.Sp
At trace level 2, the options values are shown:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    System::Command opt[12834]: cwd => "/tmp/kHkPUBIVWd"
\&    System::Command opt[12834]: fatal => {128 => 1,129 => 1}
\&    System::Command opt[12834]: git => "/usr/bin/git"
.Ve
.Sp
Note: The \f(CW\*(C`fatal\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`git\*(C'\fR options in the example above are actually
used by Git::Repository to determine the command to be run, and
ignored by System::Command. References are dumped using Data::Dumper.
.Sp
At trace level 3, the content of the \f(CW\*(C`env\*(C'\fR option is also listed:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL => "author\e@example.com"
\&    System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_NAME => "Example author"
.Ve
.Sp
If the command cannot be spawned, the trace will show \f(CW\*(C`!\*(C'\fR instead of
the pid:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    System::Command cmd[!]: does\-not\-exist
.Ve
.PP
The System::Command object returned by \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR has a number of
attributes defined (see below).
.SS "close"
.IX Subsection "close"
.Vb 1
\&    $cmd\->close;
.Ve
.PP
Close all pipes to the child process, collects exit status, etc.
and defines a number of attributes (see below).
.PP
Returns the invocant, so one can do things like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $exit = $cmd\->close\->exit;
.Ve
.SS "is_terminated"
.IX Subsection "is_terminated"
.Vb 1
\&    if ( $cmd\->is_terminated ) {...}
.Ve
.PP
Returns a true value if the underlying process was terminated.
.PP
If the process was indeed terminated, collects exit status, etc.
and defines the same attributes as \f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR, but does \fBnot\fR close
all pipes to the child process.
.SS "spawn"
.IX Subsection "spawn"
.Vb 1
\&    my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = System::Command\->spawn(@cmd);
.Ve
.PP
This shortcut method calls \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR (and so accepts options in the same
manner) and directly returns the \f(CW\*(C`pid\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`stdin\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`stdout\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`stderr\*(C'\fR
attributes, in that order.
.SS "Accessors"
.IX Subsection "Accessors"
The attributes of a System::Command object are also accessible
through a number of accessors.
.PP
The object returned by \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR will have the following attributes defined:
.IP "cmdline" 4
.IX Item "cmdline"
Return the command-line actually executed, as a list of strings.
.IP "options" 4
.IX Item "options"
The merged list of options used to run the command.
.IP "pid" 4
.IX Item "pid"
The \s-1PID\s0 of the underlying command.
.IP "stdin" 4
.IX Item "stdin"
A filehandle opened in write mode to the child process' standard input.
.IP "stdout" 4
.IX Item "stdout"
A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard output.
.IP "stderr" 4
.IX Item "stderr"
A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard error output.
.PP
Regarding the handles to the child process, note that in the following code:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $fh = System::Command\->new( @cmd )\->stdout;
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$fh\fR is opened and points to the output handle of the child process,
while the anonymous System::Command object has been destroyed. Once
\&\f(CW$fh\fR is destroyed, the subprocess will be reaped, thus avoiding zombies.
(System::Command::Reaper undertakes this process.)
.PP
After the call to \f(CW\*(C`close()\*(C'\fR or after \f(CW\*(C`is_terminated()\*(C'\fR returns true,
the following attributes will be defined:
.IP "exit" 4
.IX Item "exit"
The exit status of the underlying command.
.IP "core" 4
.IX Item "core"
A boolean value indicating if the command dumped core.
.IP "signal" 4
.IX Item "signal"
The signal, if any, that killed the command.
.SH "CAVEAT EMPTOR"
.IX Header "CAVEAT EMPTOR"
Note that System::Command uses \f(CW\*(C`waitpid()\*(C'\fR to catch the status
information of the child processes it starts. This means that if your
code (or any module you \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR) does something like the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    local $SIG{CHLD} = \*(AqIGNORE\*(Aq;    # reap child processes
.Ve
.PP
System::Command will not be able to capture the \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`core\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`signal\*(C'\fR attributes. It will instead set all of them to the
impossible value \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR, and display the warning
\&\f(CW\*(C`Child process already reaped, check for a SIGCHLD handler\*(C'\fR.
.PP
To silence this warning (and accept the impossible status information),
load System::Command with:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use System::Command \-quiet;
.Ve
.PP
It is also possible to more finely control the warning by setting
the \f(CW$System::Command::QUIET\fR variable (the warning is not emitted
if the variable is set to a true value).
.PP
If the subprocess started by System::Command has a short life
expectancy, and no other child process is expected to die during that
time, you could even disable the handler locally (use at your own risks):
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    {
\&        local $SIG{CHLD};
\&        my $cmd = System::Command\->new(@cmd);
\&        ...
\&    }

Thanks to Alexis Sukrieh (\s-1SUKRIA\s0) who, when he saw the description of
Git::Repository::Command during my talk at \s-1OSDC\s0.fr 2010, asked
why it was not an independent module. This module was started by
taking out of Git::Repository::Command 1.08 the parts that
weren't related to Git.
.PP
Thanks to Christian Walde (\s-1MITHALDU\s0) for his help in making this
module work better under Win32.
.PP
The System::Command::Reaper class was added after the addition
of Git::Repository::Command::Reaper in Git::Repository::Command 1.11.
It was later removed from System::Command version 1.03, and brought
back from the dead to deal with the zombie apocalypse in version 1.106.
