.SH "NAME"
File::chmod \- Implements symbolic and ls chmod modes
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
This is File::chmod v0.32.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\&  use File::chmod;
\&
\&  # chmod takes all three types
\&  # these all do the same thing
\&  chmod(0666,@files);
\&  chmod("=rw",@files);
\&  chmod("\-rw\-rw\-rw\-",@files);
\&
\&  # or
\&
\&  use File::chmod qw( symchmod lschmod );
\&
\&  chmod(0666,@files);           # this is the normal chmod
\&  symchmod("=rw",@files);       # takes symbolic modes only
\&  lschmod("\-rw\-rw\-rw\-",@files); # takes "ls" modes only
\&
\&  # more functions, read on to understand
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
File::chmod is a utility that allows you to bypass system calls or bit
processing of a file's permissions.  It overloads the \fIchmod()\fR function
with its own that gets an octal mode, a symbolic mode (see below), or
an \*(L"ls\*(R" mode (see below).  If you wish not to overload \fIchmod()\fR, you can
export \fIsymchmod()\fR and \fIlschmod()\fR, which take, respectively, a symbolic
mode and an \*(L"ls\*(R" mode.
.PP
Symbolic modes are thoroughly described in your \fIchmod\fR\|(1) man page, but
here are a few examples.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  # NEW: if $UMASK is true, symchmod() applies a bit\-mask found in $MASK
\&
\&  chmod("+x","file1","file2");  # overloaded chmod(), that is...
\&  # turns on the execute bit for all users on those two files
\&
\&  chmod("o=,g\-w","file1","file2");
\&  # removes \*(Aqother\*(Aq permissions, and the write bit for \*(Aqgroup\*(Aq
\&
\&  chmod("=u","file1","file2");
\&  # sets all bits to those in \*(Aquser\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
\&\*(L"ls\*(R" modes are the type produced on the left-hand side of an \f(CW\*(C`ls \-l\*(C'\fR on a
directory.  Examples are:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  chmod("\-rwxr\-xr\-x","file1","file2");
\&  # the 0755 setting; user has read\-write\-execute, group and others
\&  # have read\-execute priveleges
\&
\&  chmod("\-rwsrws\-\-\-","file1","file2");
\&  # sets read\-write\-execute for user and group, none for others
\&  # also sets set\-uid and set\-gid bits
.Ve
.PP
The regular \fIchmod()\fR and \fIlschmod()\fR are absolute; that is, they are not
appending to or subtracting from the current file mode.  They set it,
regardless of what it had been before.  \fIsymchmod()\fR is useful for allowing
the modifying of a file's permissions without having to run a system call
or determining the file's permissions, and then combining that with whatever
bits are appropriate.  It also operates separately on each file.
.PP
An added feature to version 0.30 is the \f(CW$UMASK\fR variable, explained below; if
\&\fIsymchmod()\fR is called and this variable is true, then the function uses the
(also new) \f(CW$MASK\fR variable (which defaults to \fIumask()\fR) as a mask against the
new mode.  This is documented below more clearly.

.SS "Variables"
.IX Subsection "Variables"
.ie n .IP "$File::chmod::DEBUG" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$File::chmod::DEBUG\fR" 4
.IX Item "$File::chmod::DEBUG"
If set to a true value, it will report warnings, similar to those produced
by \fIchmod()\fR on your system.  Otherwise, the functions will not report errors.
Example: a file can not have file-locking and the set-gid bits on at the
same time.  If \f(CW$File::chmod::DEBUG\fR is true, the function will report an
error.  If not, you are not warned of the conflict.  It is set to 1 as
default.
.ie n .IP "$File::chmod::MASK" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$File::chmod::MASK\fR" 4
.IX Item "$File::chmod::MASK"
Contains the umask to apply to new file modes when using \fIgetsymchmod()\fR.  This
defaults to the return value of \fIumask()\fR at compile time.  Is only applied if
\&\f(CW$UMASK\fR is true.
.ie n .IP "$File::chmod::UMASK" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$File::chmod::UMASK\fR" 4
.IX Item "$File::chmod::UMASK"
This is a boolean which tells \fIgetsymchmod()\fR whether or not to apply the umask
found in \f(CW$MASK\fR.  It defaults to true.

.IX Item "fixed getsymchmod() bug"
Whoa.  \fIgetsymchmod()\fR was doing some crazy ish.  That's about all I can say.
I did a great deal of debugging, and fixed it up.  It \s-1ALL\s0 had to do with two
things:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $or = (/+=/ ? 1 : 0); # should have been /[+=]/
\&
\&  /u/ && $ok ? u_or() : u_not(); # should have been /u/ and $ok
.Ve
.IP "\fBfixed \f(BIgetmod()\fB bug\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixed getmod() bug"
I was using \fImap()\fR incorrectly in \fIgetmod()\fR.  Fixed that.
.IP "\fBcondensed \f(BIlschmod()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "condensed lschmod()"
I shorted it up, getting rid a variable.
.SS "0.21 to 0.30"
.IX Subsection "0.21 to 0.30"
.IP "\fBadded \f(BIumask()\fB honoring for \f(BIsymchmod()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "added umask() honoring for symchmod()"
The \fIsymchmod()\fR function now honors the \f(CW$UMASK\fR and \f(CW$MASK\fR variables.  \f(CW$UMASK\fR is
a boolean which indicates whether or not to honor the \f(CW$MASK\fR variable.  \f(CW$MASK\fR
holds a umask, and it defaults to \fIumask()\fR.  \f(CW$UMASK\fR defaults to true.  These
variables are \s-1NOT\s0 exported.  They must explictly set (i.e. \f(CW$File::chmod::UMASK\fR
= 0).
.IP "\fBfunction name changes\fR" 4
.IX Item "function name changes"
Renamed internal function \fIdetermine_mode()\fR to \fImode()\fR.  However, if you happen
to be using \fIdetermine_mode()\fR somewhere, \fImode()\fR will be called, but you'll also
get a warning about deprecation.
.Sp
Renamed internal functions {or,not}_{l,s,t} to {l,s,t}_{or,not}.  This is to
keep in standard with the \s-1OTHER\s0 6 pairs of bitwise functions, such as \fIr_or()\fR
and \fIg_not()\fR.  I don't know \s-1WHY\s0 the others had 'not' or 'or' in the front.
.IP "\fBfixed debugging bugs\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixed debugging bugs"
Certain calls to \fIwarn()\fR were not guarded by the \f(CW$DEBUG\fR variable, and now they
are.  Also, for some reason, I left a debugging check (that didn't check to
see if \f(CW$DEBUG\fR was true) in \fIgetsymchmod()\fR, line 118.  It printed \*(L"\s-1ENTERING\s0 /g/\*(R".
It's gone now.
.IP "\fBfixed set-uid and set-gid bug\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixed set-uid and set-gid bug"
Heh, it seems that in the previous version of File::chmod, the following code
went along broken:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  # or_s sub, File/chmod.pm, v0.21, line 330
\&  ($VAL & 00100) && do {
\&    $DEBUG && warn("execute bit must be on for set\-uid"); 1;
\&  } && next;
.Ve
.Sp
Aside from me using '&&' more than enough (changed in the new code), this is
broken.  This is now fixed.
.IP "\fBfixed file lock/set\-gid bug\fR" 4
.IX Item "fixed file lock/set-gid bug"
The \fInot_l()\fR function (now renamed to \fIl_not()\fR) used to take the file mode and
bit-wise \s-1NOT\s0 it with ~02000.  However, it did not check if the file was locked
vs. set-gid.  Now, the function is \f(CW\*(C`$VAL &= ~02000 if not $VAL & 00010;\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBremoved useless data structures\fR" 4
.IX Item "removed useless data structures"
I do not know why I had the \f(CW$S\fR variable, or \f(CW%r\fR, \f(CW%w\fR, and \f(CW%x\fR hashes.  In fact,
\&\f(CW$S\fR was declared in \f(CW\*(C`use vars qw( ... );\*(C'\fR, but never given a value, and the
\&\f(CW%r\fR, \f(CW%w\fR, and \f(CW%x\fR hashes had a 'full' key which never got used.  And the hashes
themselves weren't really needed anyway.  Here is a list of the variables no
longer in use, and what they have been replaced with (if any):
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  $S            nothing
\&  $U, $G, $O    $W
\&  %r, %w, %x    octal numbers
\&  @files        @_ (I had @files = @_; in nearly EVERY sub)
\&  $c            $_
.Ve
.IP "\fBcompacted code\fR" 4
.IX Item "compacted code"
The first version of File::chmod that was published was 0.13, and it was
written in approximately 10 days, being given the off-and-on treatment I end
up having to give several projects, due to more pressing matters.  Well, since
then, most of the code has stayed the same, although bugs were worked out.
Well, I got rid of a lot of slow, clunky, and redundant sections of code in
this version.  Sections include the processing of each character of the mode
in \fIgetsymchmod()\fR, the \fIgetmod()\fR subroutine, um, nearly \s-1ALL\s0 of the \fIgetsymchmod()\fR
function, now that I look at it.
.Sp
Here's part of the \fIgetsymchmod()\fR rewrite:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&  for ($c){
\&    if (/u/){
\&      u_or() if $MODE eq "+" or $MODE eq "=";
\&      u_not() if $MODE eq "\-";
\&    }
\&  ...
\&  }
\&
\&  # changed to
\&
\&  /u/ && $or ? u_or() : u_and();
\&  # note: operating on $_, $c isn\*(Aqt used anymore
\&  # note: $or holds 1 if the $MODE was + or =, 0 if $MODE was \-
\&  # note: previous was redundant.  didn\*(Aqt need $MODE eq "\-" check
\&  #       because u_or() and u_not() both go to the next character
