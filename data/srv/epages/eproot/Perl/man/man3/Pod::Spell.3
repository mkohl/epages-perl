Pod::Spell \-\- a formatter for spellchecking Pod
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 3
\&  % podspell Thing.pm | ispell
\& or if you don\*(Aqt have a podspell:
\&  % perl \-MPod::Spell \-e "Pod::Spell\->new\->parse_from_file(shift)" Thing.pm |spell |fmt
\&
\& or:
\&  % perl \-MPod::Spell \-e "Pod::Spell\->new\->parse_from_filehandle"
\&  ...which takes POD on STDIN and sends formatted text to STDOUT
.Ve
.PP
\&...or instead of piping to spell or ispell, use \f(CW\*(C`>temp.txt\*(C'\fR, and open
\&\fItemp.txt\fR in your word processor for spell-checking.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for
spellchecking.  Pod::Spell rather like Pod::Text, except that
it doesn't put much effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things
that look like Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking
program won't complain about mystery words like "\f(CW$thing\fR\*(L" 
or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`Foo::Bar\*(C'\fR\*(L" or \*(R"hashref").
.PP
This class provides no new public methods.  All methods of interest are
inherited from Pod::Parser (which see).  The especially
interesting ones are \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_filehandle\*(C'\fR (which without arguments
takes from \s-1STDIN\s0 and sends to \s-1STDOUT\s0) and \f(CW\*(C`parse_from_file\*(C'\fR.  But you
can probably just make do with the examples in the synopsis though.
.PP
This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any
form of computerese (like "\f(CW$thing\fR\*(L" or \*(R"\f(CW\*(C`N>7\*(C'\fR\*(L" or
\&\*(R"\f(CW\*(C`@{$foo}{\*(Aqbar\*(Aq,\*(Aqbaz\*(Aq}\*(C'\fR", anything in C<...> or F<...>
codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs (codeblocks), and anything
in the stopword list.  The default stopword list for a document starts
out from the stopword list defined by Pod::Wordlist,
and can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by having 
\&\f(CW"=for stopwords"\fR / \f(CW"=for :stopwords"\fR region(s) in a document.
.SH "ADDING STOPWORDS"
.IX Header "ADDING STOPWORDS"
You can add stopwords on a per-document basis with
\&\f(CW"=for stopwords"\fR / \f(CW"=for :stopwords"\fR regions, like so:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  =for stopwords  plok Pringe zorch   snik !qux
\&  foo bar baz quux quuux
.Ve
.PP
This adds every word in that paragraph after \*(L"stopwords\*(R" to the
stopword list, effective for the rest of the document.  In such a
list, words are whitespace-separated.  (The amount of whitespace
doesn't matter, as long as there's no blank lines in the middle
of the paragraph.)  Words beginning with \*(L"!\*(R" are
\&\fIdeleted\fR from the stopword list \*(-- so \*(L"!qux\*(R" deletes \*(L"qux\*(R" from the
stopword list, if it was in there in the first place.  Note that if
a stopword is all-lowercase, then it means that it's okay in \fIany\fR
case; but if the word has any capital letters, then it means that
it's okay \fIonly\fR with \fIthat\fR case.  So a wordlist entry of \*(L"perl\*(R"
would permit \*(L"perl\*(R", \*(L"Perl\*(R", and (less interestingly) \*(L"\s-1PERL\s0\*(R", \*(L"pERL\*(R",
\&\*(L"PerL\*(R", et cetera.  However, a wordlist entry of \*(L"Perl\*(R" catches
only \*(L"Perl\*(R", not \*(L"perl\*(R".  So if you wanted to make sure you said
only \*(L"Perl\*(R", never \*(L"perl\*(R", you could add this to the top of your
document:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  =for stopwords !perl Perl
.Ve
.PP
Then all instances of the word \*(L"Perl\*(R" would be weeded out of the
Pod::Spell\-formatted version of your document, but any instances of
the word \*(L"perl\*(R" would be left in (unless they were in a C<...> or 
F<...> style).
.PP
You can have several \*(L"=for stopwords\*(R" regions in your document.  You
can even express them like so:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  =begin stopwords
\&
\&  plok Pringe zorch
\&
\&  snik !qux
\&
\&  foo bar
\&  baz quux quuux 
\&
\&  =end stopwords
.Ve
.PP
If you want to use E<...> sequences in a \*(L"stopwords\*(R" region, you
have to use \*(L":stopwords\*(R", as here:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  =for :stopwords
\&  virtE<ugrave>
.Ve
.PP
\&...meaning that you're adding a stopword of \*(L"virtu\*`\*(R".  If
you left the \*(L":\*(R" out, that'd mean you were adding a stopword of
\&\*(L"virtE<ugrave>\*(R" (with a literal E, a literal <, etc), which
will have no effect, since  any occurrences of virtE<ugrave>
don't look like a normal human-language word anyway, and so would
be screened out before the stopword list is consulted anyway.
.SH "USING Pod::Spell"
.IX Header "USING Pod::Spell"
My personal advice:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Write your documentation in Pod.  Pod is described in
perlpod.  And perlmodstyle has some
advice on content.  This is the stage where you want to make sure
you say everything you should, have good and working examples,
and have coherent grammar.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Run it through podchecker.  This will report all sorts of problems with
your Pod; you may choose to ignore some of these problems.  Some, like
\&\*(L"*** \s-1WARNING:\s0 Unknown entity E<qacute>...\*(R", you should pay attention
to.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Once podchecker errors have been tended to, spellcheck the pod by
running it through podspell / Pod::Spell.  For any misspellings that are
reported in the Pod::Spell\-formatted text, fix them in the
original.  Repeat until there's no complaints.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Run it through podchecker again just for good measure.

.SH "HINT"
.IX Header "HINT"
If you feed output of Pod::Spell into your word processor and run a
spell-check, make sure you're \fInot\fR also running a grammar-check \*(-- because
Pod::Spell drops words that it thinks are Perl symbols, jargon, or
stopwords, this means you'll have ungrammatical sentences, what with
words being missing and all.  And you don't need a grammar checker
to tell you that.
